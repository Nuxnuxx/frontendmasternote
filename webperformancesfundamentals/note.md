## Measuring web performance

### old way was the measure of page load from nothing to the full page load

### new way :
- fcp : first content paint
    - the time until the user sees an indication that the page is loading
- lcp : largest content paint
    - the time until the user sees most of the page and believes it is (almost) ready
- cls : cumulative layout shift
    - the movement distance and impact of page elements during the entire lifetime of the document the user sees.
- fid : first input delay
    - the browser time delay between the user's first click and execution of application code
